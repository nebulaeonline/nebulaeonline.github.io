The nebulae project is envisioned as an educational introduction to systems programming.  This is intended to be a long-term project, a labor of love, if you will.

Currently, there's just a bit of UEFI C code and some (very old) Zig code.

Otherwise, keep checking back and we'll update this section as more content is added.
